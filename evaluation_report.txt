WEEK 2 – MODEL EVALUATION REPORT
---

Model: MobileNetV2 (Fine-Tuned)
Dataset: Clean vs Dirty Water Dataset
Classes: Clean Water, Polluted Water

Training Accuracy: 93.0 %
Validation Accuracy: 92.86 %
Loss: 0.0873

Classification Report:
- Clean Water: Precision = 1.00, Recall = 0.89, F1 = 0.94
- Polluted Water: Precision = 0.83, Recall = 1.00, F1 = 0.91

Observations:
• Model shows improved performance compared to Week 1.  
• Fine-tuning top 20 layers and using a lower learning rate (1e-5) helped reduce validation loss.  
• Perfect recall for polluted water images indicates strong environmental detection capability.
